# shop.etoh.pro

A simple website that allows you to preview today's shop for [Eternal Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Eternal-Towers-of-Hell) as well as past shop items.

## How can I contribute?

If you want to contribute to the current shop (or past items), you can do so in the `/data` folder.
- `items.json` - Full list of items.
- `shop.json` - List of items in today and past shop rotations.

Note that images (and videos) should be in the webp and webm format. (WIP, files need converted!)
- Asset directory should follow `assets/<type>/<name>.[webp|webm]`. (Example: `assets/emotes/dance.webm`)
